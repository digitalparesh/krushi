      <div class="h3 text-center">How To Become Full Stack Developer in 2020?</div>
      <div class="font fontSize">
        <p class="mt-5 mb-5 markbg bg-warning">Full stack web developers are the Swiss Army knife of the
          code world.
          Having
          that
          designation
          means you can
          produce end to end solutions, which is a highly marketable and agile skillset. But what does it actually take
          to achieve that status?</p>
        <p>
          So the question arises “What is the role of a Full Stack Web Developer?”
        </p>
        <p>Well, a Full Stack Web Developer is the guy (or gal) who works on both the front-end and back-end portions of
          an
          application while also knowing various other areas like Databases, Version Control System, Designing, etc.
          There
          are various skill sets that are needed to fulfill all these never-ending requirements. So let’s focus on that
          now!</p>
        <p>
          Skills required to become a Full Stack Web Developer
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Full Stack Ninja must have their tools! And so there are multiple skills that are required for a Full
          Stack Web Developer ranging across different fields. Most of them are mentioned below:
        </p>
        <p class="h5">
          1. Front End Development
        </p>
        <p>Always wanted to be an Artist? Well, never fear!
        </p>
        <p>The artist in a Full Stack Web Developer is fully unleashed for Front End Development as it deals with the
          application parts that the users can see and interact with. The main technologies required for Front End
          development are HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. And that’s not all! Extra knowledge of third-party libraries like
          jQuery, Angular and ReactJs, etc. is also extremely helpful.
        </p>
        <p class="h5">2. Back End Development
        </p>
        <p>While front-end is the part of the application the user sees, the back end is often the mystical part that
          remains unseen. It handles the database operations, user authentication and application logic (Yeah, all the
          complicated things!). There are multiple languages that are used in Back End Development such as Java, Python,
          PHP, Ruby, NodeJs, etc. While every developer claims that their favorite language is the best, all of these
          languages have a market demand for suitable projects.
        </p>
        <p class="h5">3. Databases
        </p>
        <p>What can an application manage without data? Well, nothing at all!
        </p>
        <p>And that’s why a database is the most important part of any application as it is required to store and access
          the data. So a Full Stack Web Developer needs to know the divide between Relational and NoSQL databases to
          understand the situations in which each would be useful. They should also be familiar with databases of each
          type such as MySQL, MongoDB, etc. In addition to all this, knowledge of caching options such as Redis,
          Memcached, and Varnish would only be a plus!
        </p>
        <p class="h5">4. Version Control System
        </p>
        <p>There are multiple versions of an application. Now, what if a particular version needs to be recalled? That’s
          where the Version Control System comes in. It’s basically a system that records the changes made to the
          application files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later if required.
        </p>
        <p>Git, in particular, is a Version Control System System that can be used to obtain the latest code, update
          parts of the code, and change other people’s code as well without creating a major mess of things!!!
        </p>

        <p class="h5">MERN stack
        </p>
        <p>
          The MERN stack is also founded on JavaScript-based technologies like MEAN stack(although it’s not so mean!).
          It has four major components that are given as follows:
        </p>
        <p>MongoDB: A NoSQL Database that stores data in binary JSON format.
        </p>
        <p>Express: A web program framework that is easy to use, light and portable.
        </p>
        <p>React: A javascript library that is used for building user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>Node.js: a server-side JavaScript execution environment.
