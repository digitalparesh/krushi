        <p class="text-justify">Groundnut belongs to family Leguminoceae (Fabaceae) sub-family Papilionoideae. Five states namely Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu account for about 80% of the total groundnut area and production of the country. Gujarat alone contributes about 35% of the total production of groundnut. Groundnut is a typical crop which requires a long warm growing season while water logging, drought and cold weathers are extremely detrimental to its growth.Soils that are well drained, light coloured, loose, fertile, sandy loam, rich in calcium and moderate organic matter with pH ranging from 5.0 to 8.5 is ideal for groundnut cultivation

        <p class="text-justify">
          Targa Super effectively controls the narrow leaf weeds like Echinochloa spp., Goose grass, fox tail, Cynodon (doob), Large crab grass, Saccharum sp. (kans), Hemarthria sp. (suttu), Wild sorghum, Volunteer paddy, Volunteer maize, Volunteer pearl millet, etc. Targa Super is very quickly absorbed by the weeds and translocated and kill the weeds. The affected weeds are unable to regenerate.  It is quickly absorbed by the weeds, hence rain even one hour after spray does not affect its effectiveness. Weed leaves turn puplish/ red within 5-8 days after Targa Super application and within 10-15 days are completely killed.

The cotton whitefly is a pest of primary importance for fibre, horticultural and ornamental crops worldwide. It can cause extensive damage through direct feeding, honeydew production and as a viral vector.

          Weedmar Super is used on a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic broadleaf weeds. It has little effect on grasses. It appears to work by causing uncontrolled cell division in vascular tissue. Abnormal increases in cell wall plasticity, biosynthesis of proteins, and production of ethylene occur in plant tissues following exposure, and these processes are responsible for uncontrolled cell division. The ester forms of 2, 4-D penetrate foliage, whereas plant roots absorb the salt forms. 2, 4-D appears to be similar in action to other auxin-type herbicides. .It is absorbed by the leaves and roots and translocated in to the weed plants.

          SEMPRA is the first herbicide introduced in India by Dhanuka Agritech Ltd for effective control of Cyperus rotundus. It is a selective, systemic, post-emergence herbicide with WDG formulation for effective control of Cyperus rotundus from nuts in Sugarcane and Maize crop.SEMPRA has strong systemic action i.e. moves in both ways through Xylem & Phloem. SEMPRA stops the metabolic functions of Cyperus by stopping formation of the amino acids (Valin, Isoleucine, Lucine) which is responsible for the protein required for growth of the Cyperus resulting in yellowing of its leaves & nuts becoming darker & further destroying it in 14-30 days. SEMPRA has been extensively evaluated and recommended by institution/ universities like Vasantdada Sugar Institute (Maharashtra), Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Regional Research Station (Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar), Agricultural Research Station (University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharward), U. P. Council of Sugarcane Research, Narendra Deva University of Agriculture & Technology, Faizabad (UP).SEMPRA is internationally registered in countries like India, Japan, U.S.A, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia & South Africa.

        <span style="color: green">MODE OF ACTION</span>
        <p class="text-justify">
          SEMPRA, being a sulfonylurea group herbicide, inhibits acetolactate synthase (ALS), which is the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the essential branched chain amino acide (Valine, Leucine & isoleucine). Inhibition of ALS leads to the starvation of the plant (Cyperus rotundus) for these amino acids, resulting in death (killing) of weeds. For crop plants, in the grass family like maize sugarcane, etc. there is no effect of Sempra as these plant have strong MFO (mixed function oxidases which breaks down the herbicide molecule to acid metabolite forms.

        <p class="text-justify">
        <ul>
          <li>Efficacy at Low Dose: Sempra provides outstanding control of Cyperus rotundus at 36 gm/acre. It also offers soil residual activity and controls late emerging weeds. Compared to traditional herbicides it's dosage is low.
          </li>
          <li>Nutrient uptake checked: Sempra checks nutrient uptake by Cyperus Rotundus within 24 hrs of application resulting in good healthy crop.

          </li>
          <li> Safe to Crop: Sempra does not harm the crop of Sugarcane & Maize.</li>
          <li>Strong Soil Residual Action: Sempra has strong residual action due to which it controls new germinating Cyperus rotundus.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced Weeding Expenses: Sempra gives freedom from repeated manual weeding which leads to saving manual labour cost in herbicides application.
          </li>
          <li>Increase Yield: Sempra results in more yield hence more profits.

        <p class="text-justify">Lustre is a unique new combination of two systemic fungicides. It’s a broad spectrum, dual systemic fungicide which controls a wide range of fungal diseases. Its DSC technology provides longer duration control on diseases and helps the plant to attain its natural growth thereby improves the quality of products and enhances the yield and profit of farmers.

        </p>
        <span style="color: green">MODE OF ACTION</span>
        <p class="text-justify">
          It has dual systemic action and acropetal & basipetal movement. It inhibits the development of fungi by interfering with spindle formation at mitosis. Lustre is a fungicide of Benzimidazole and Triazole group technology, its a broad and strong systemic fungicide which has Phyto-Tonic effect. Lustre interferes in process of building the structure of fungal cell wall. Finally it inhibits the reproduction and further growth of fungus. It also interferes with respiration in plant pathogenic fungi.
